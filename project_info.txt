I have a bunch of images in form of jpg and png in the "img1" directory. These images are photos taken by a phone camera,
as such a lot of these photos display the date of the time they were taken and it looks something like the following example 02/05/2023.
Each one represents a photo of an etiquette or a label that sometimes has a QR code and a bunch of information about a product.
These stickers contain specific information about different products. Please note that the language used on these etiquettes or 
labels is mostly German and sometimes English. I will give you some examples about the kind of information these images have;

Please note that the following text is written in German and the English translation in shown right under it.

In German:

Artikelname
Artikelnummer
MHD (Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum)
Einfrierdatum
Erntejahr
LAX
Produktionscode 
Batch
Lot

In English:

Item name
Item number
Best before date (MHD)
Freezing date
Harvest year
LAX
Production code 
Batch
Lot

The goal is to programmatically retrieve all the information that are on the label.
To tackle this problem we will be using platform openapi, Google Vision and python.

In this case, the OpenAI API is used to interact with the GPT-3 language model, we will be using the following model:
model: text-davinci-003

The API allows the code to send a prompt (text input) to the GPT-3 model and receive generated text as a response.

To summarize, the extraction of text from images is done using Tesseract OCR, while the generation of formatted information based on the extracted text is performed by GPT-3.


Please note that the displayed date of the time the photos were taken (mostly visible/shown in the bottom right corner of the image)
is not of any importance, which means that it should be ignored and not extracted along with the other data.

Please also note that the "images" directory has two subdirectories, one for the ".jpg" images and the other for ".png".
 
Make the code in such a way that a pdf file will be generated that contains all the extracted text from each image in a user-friendly manner,
preferably in a bullet point format along with displaying each image next to the corresponding text.

Since each image is unique, our code has to be flexible and smart when dealing with the images.
Which means that if a "Lot" or a "production date" is not present or missing on the etiquette,
the code has to inform me as such. For example the code can return a message saying "Information not available".

The messages should be displayed in two different sections. The first section should be on the left side of the document
and written in German. The second section should be on the right side of the document and written in English.
I'm specifically talking about the following data that should be extracted and displayed in the above mentioned message:

Artikelname
Artikelnummer
MHD (Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum)
Einfrierdatum
Erntejahr
LAX
Produktionscode 
Batch
Lot
